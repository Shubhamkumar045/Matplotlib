    "Q1: What is Matplotlib? Why is it used? Name five plots\n",
    "that can be plotted using the Pyplot module of\n",
    "Matplotlib.\n",
    "Answer--Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, interactive, \n",
    "and animated visualizations in Python. It provides a wide range of functionalities\n",
    "to generate high-quality plots, charts, and figures for various purposes.\n",
    "Matplotlib is extensively used in fields such as data science, machine learning,\n",
    "scientific computing, and more.\n",
    "Five common plots that can be created using the Pyplot module of Matplotlib are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Line Plot: Displays data points connected by straight lines.\n",
    "It is commonly used to visualize trends and patterns over continuous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter Plot: Represents individual data points as markers on a 2D plane.\n",
    "It is useful for visualizing the relationship between two variables\n",
    "and identifying patterns, clusters, or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Histogram: Shows the distribution of a continuous variable by dividing the\n",
    "data into bins and displaying the frequency of observations in each bin. \n",
    "Histograms are useful for understanding the underlying distribution of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bar Plot: Represents categorical data using rectangular bars with heights or \n",
    "lengths proportional to the values they represent. Bar plots are suitable for\n",
    "comparing values across different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pie Chart: Displays data as a circular chart divided into sectors, where each\n",
    "sector represents a proportion of the whole. Pie charts are useful for visualizing \n",
    "the relative contributions of different categories to a total.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: What is a scatter plot? Use the following code to generate data for x and y. Using this generated data\n",
    "plot a scatter plot.\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "np.random.seed(3)\n",
    "x = 3 + np.random.normal(0, 2, 50)\n",
    "y = 3 + np.random.normal(0, 2, len(x))\n",
    "Note: Also add title, xlabel, and ylabel to the plot.\n",

    "Q3: Why is the subplot() function used? Draw four line plots using the subplot() function.\n",
    "Use the following data:\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "For line 1: x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) and y = np.array([0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500])\n",

    "Answer--The subplot() function in Matplotlib is used to create multiple plots within the same figure.\n",
    "It allows you to arrange plots in a grid-like fashion, specifying the number of rows and columns\n",
    "and the position of each subplot within the grid.\n",
